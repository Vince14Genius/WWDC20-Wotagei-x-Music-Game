# WWDC20-Wotagei-x-Music-Game
WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge Submission - Swift PlaygroundBook "Wotagei x Music Game"

This project is very rushed but I tried.

I didn't do ARKit again because both of my previous two ARKit submissions were rejected.

The header comments were not converted into Markup because Markup & iCloud syncing bugs made me lose all my previous Markup comments near the last moment; I restored everything I could but did not have enough time to test Markup again (and risk losing all those comments again) so I just kept them in the normal comments form. (I wrote about this in the "Comments" section of the written essay responses too)

The core functionalities of this playground is completed and largely without problems (unlike the two previous years). However, I did not have enough time to make important features such as sound ("music"), score-keeping systems, more content, etc.

Overall I think my chances of winning are very slight. I'll be expecting yet another "Your WWDC Scholarship Status Update" (or "Your WWDC Swift Student Challenge Status Update") email lol.
